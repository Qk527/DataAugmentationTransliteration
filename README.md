# DataAugmentationTransliteration
Small approach to data augmentation techniques in NLP.

One of the biggest problems in NLP tasks is the amount of data you have to train your model.

Data augmentation methods allow to generate synthetic data to improve modelÂ´s performance.

In this notebook, I used Back Translation method to generate additional data to original dataframe, using Helsinki-NLP model to trasnlate text to English and back to Spanish.
